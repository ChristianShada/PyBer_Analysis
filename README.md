# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis has been completed in order to find out how the urban, suburban, and rural areas compare to one another based on their city type and the average fare each month in the first part of the year.<br/>
<br/>
## Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summary, we found that spending within the rural area was not as high as in the suburban or urban areas. Mostly this is to the fact that destinations are further apart from each other and people are more willing to utilize a ride, versus walking. The lower results you will find in the rural parts of town are due to the opposite where traveling is not that far from place to place. People are more willing to walk, bike, or other modes of transportation based on time of day and what day it is. This graph will help you project/track the following year ahead. Or, compare it to trends from previous years.

## Summary
_**Based on these results, please see the below recommenations:**_
  - Eleminate the Suburban fare type. Allow the Rural and Urban to reach further out past their limits. This will close the gap between the two types. Additionally, this would allow your Rural drivers the opportunity for larger fares, and thusly larger tips with happier employees.
  - There is a spike towards the end of February within all the City Types then a dip/spike combination towards the end of April for the Rural and Urban. This shows an inconsistancy within ridership. Were there events that either promoted these hills/valleys? Are they repeating events that we will see in the future? If not, then those riderships need to be categporized as an outlier.
  - Re-draw your lines in regards to the Rural, Suburban, and Urban areas. There is such a disparancy between the highest high of the Suburban area and the Rural. Based on the numbers they are bringing in, you either need to re-draw the lines, or I would cut the Rural and let the another transportation company work it. Topping out a $500 in April, the overhead must be way more than that and it's not worth the risk.
